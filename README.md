# Cross-validation-of-models
1. Fit polynomial models of varying degrees to the Auto dataset and visualize their fit against the data using scatterplots.
2. Compare models using validation set splits and cross-validation approaches like LOOCV and k-fold CV, evaluating performance with metrics like RMSE and MAD.
3. Fit linear, polynomial, and exponential/logarithmic models to the economics dataset and compare them using cross-validation and graphical methods.
4. Summarize results in tables, explain the effects of underfitting and overfitting, and discuss the role of cross-validation in model selection.
